# Hello World Button

This is a simple GUI app for converting values from miles to kilometers. This example is created by following the guides provided in this [YouTube video](https://youtu.be/mop6g-c5HEY?si=c9zKxbXWSSwoF4FV&t=65) that you can watch if you want a comprehensive explanation. Kudos to [Clear Code](https://www.youtube.com/@ClearCode) for the guide.

Here we are introduced with 4 different kinds of widgets, namely:
- Label
- Frame/Container
- Entry/Input/Textbox
- Button

In this example, `ttkbootstrap` module is used for styling the GUI app. Additionally, some comment lines and hint are provided in the code if you wish to use the default `ttk` style.
