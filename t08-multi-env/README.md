# Multi Env Runner

This is an example app that will run 2 different virtual environment on Conda and simply show the installed Python version from each virtual environment.

For this app to run, make sure you have **Anaconda** or **Miniconda** installed on your system and added to your environment path.

To try this example, ideally you should have 2 different virtual environment installed with different version of Python.
For example, I have virtual enviroment named `venv1` with **Python 3.9**
 and another virtual environment named `venv2` with **Python 3.10**.

This app has been tested on Windows 11.
