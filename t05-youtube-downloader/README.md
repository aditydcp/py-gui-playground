# Youtube Downloader

This is a simple GUI app that lets you input a link to a YouTube video and download the corresponding video. This example is created by following the guides provided in this [YouTube video](https://youtu.be/NI9LXzo0UY0?si=sa3bzgoDSwBh8HEX) that you can watch if you want a comprehensive explanation. Kudos to [developedbyed](https://www.youtube.com/@developedbyed) for the guide.

In this example, we will be using `customtkinter` module to stylize our UI and `pytube` module to download the YouTube Video.

In case you want to use virtual environment, all modules required are provided in `requirements.txt`. Simply run this code to install all required packages:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Apart from what is already present from the video guide, this example also have Output Directory Target feature that lets you choose which directory you want your video to be saved in.
