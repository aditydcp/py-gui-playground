Repository for Python GUI Desktop App templates using Tkinter.

Here you will find several simple desktop apps, namely:
- **Hello World Button**. A simple GUI with 1 button that will show the text "Hello World".
- **Distance Converter**. Simple GUI app that converts value from miles to kilometers.
- **Simple Calculator**. Simple basic calculator.
- **File Browser**. Simple GUI to browse for a particular file and get its path.
- **Youtube Downloader**. Simple app that lets you download Youtube video via link.
- **Sticky Notes**. A digital sticky notes (kind of) app that lets you create, view, update and delete notes saved as a `.txt` files.
- **App Simulator**. Mockup GUI App that simulates a certain workflow.
- **Multi Env**. Simple example app that runs two different processes in two different `conda` virtual environments.

## Suggestion

If you're here to learn about Python and Tkinter for desktop app development, I recommend you to tackle the examples one by one starting from `t01` to the end, as each example is more complex that the one before and also tackles new concepts.
